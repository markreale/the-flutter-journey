# The Flutter Journey

A journey into Flutter. Dreams of beauty. Dreams of quality.

## A Call to Action

You find yourself in a situation where you have been tasked with delivering an important message.

You must make the message available throughout the world through phone devices generally connected to some form of network.

Your journey begins.

## Time is of the Essence

You look around for options to use to create and distribute your message. You learn of the framework 'Flutter'.

Flutter presents itself as capable of "Making High Quality Apps in Record Time". Flutter also carries the promise of easy distribution to prominent mobile platforms 'Android' and 'iOS'.

Quality is nice to have, but the promise of speed to develop and mass distribution win you over.

You are convinced.

You will assemble your message with Flutter, and distribute it.

## Getting the Message Together

In order to assemble your message using the Flutter framework, you collect all the relevant tools:
* a computer
* an electricity source to run the computer
* a network connection for the computer
* an Operating System on the computer to run your development programs
* a web browser to find documents about how to make things using Flutter

You start reading the documents.

You download the necessary tools to build your Flutter application

You install Android Studio. You can now write the program that will deliver your message.

You install an Emulator to emulate the devices that your message will be available to.

The documents tell you to install some additional plugin functionality for Android Studio, so you install them.

You are ready to go.

You create a new Flutter application.

There is a default Flutter application there, but it features a whole bunch of foreign details.

You don't want to deal with this.

You need to make some decisions.
